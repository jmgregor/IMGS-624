# Putt-putt Golf Interactive Virtual Enviroment
### IMGS-624: Interactive Virtual Environments

**Motivation:** Putt-putt golf, or otherwise known as miniature golf, is a game well known and loved by
many. The game requires a basic understand of math and physics in order to determine the best shot to
take to get the lowest score. These skills are great for children to understand at a young age, even if
they are introduced subliminally. Along with this, putt-putt golf is fun and challenging for people of all
ages!

**Limitation:** There are many limitations that prevent people from going out to play mini golf. First, the
game requires you to walk around a small course with a club and your ball. Many people with
disabilities, such as being in a wheel chair, may never be able to go out onto the green and attempt to
play the game. Recent global pandemicâ€™s such as the corona virus are creating standards of social
distancing and extra alertness of public health. These mindsets may cause parents to think twice about
bringing their family to play mini golf in a public setting. Lastly and most simply, bad weather can cause
a mini golf place to shut down completely since the game is mainly enjoyed in the sun.

**Approach to resolve this limitation:** All of these limitations can be resolved by recreating the beloved
game in a virtual environment. With the use of a head mounted display, people can be placed in a
virtual world that I will create where they can play mini golf in the comfort of their own living room.
